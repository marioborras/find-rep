This was my final project at New York Code And Design Academy.
I wanted to make a web app that a user could put their address and find all their elected officials from federal,state 
local levels. Each politician has a photo, their name and how to contact them. Along with their contact info is their social
media channels. The information is pulled from the Google Civics API.

I wanted the search bar to had an auto complete feature to make sure the names of addresses and towns would all work so I used the Google
Maps API to assist with this.

I had to find ways to deal with anomalies such as a vacant office or all the different social channels that existed.
In order to store the data I used HTML local storage.

During election season, the app also tells you the polling location of a residential address.
